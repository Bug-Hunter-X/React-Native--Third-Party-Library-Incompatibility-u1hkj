# React Native: Third-Party Library Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose bug in React Native applications: incompatibility issues with third-party libraries after updates to React Native itself.

## The Problem

Third-party libraries often rely on specific versions of React Native's internal APIs. When you update React Native, these APIs might change, breaking the library's functionality.

The resulting errors are often cryptic, making debugging challenging.  You might see blank screens, unexpected behavior, or runtime crashes without clear indications of the root cause.

## Solution

The key is to carefully manage library versions and ensure compatibility.  Consult the library's documentation and release notes to identify any potential conflicts with your React Native version.

Consider using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect your dependency tree and look for version mismatches.  Sometimes downgrading the third-party library or updating to a version that explicitly supports your React Native version might be necessary.  If possible, look for alternatives.

Using a version management tool like `nvm` for Node.js can also be beneficial.
