The solution involves careful version management and potentially finding alternative compatible libraries or downgrading if necessary.

1. **Check Library Compatibility:**  Examine the `my-third-party-library`'s documentation and release notes for compatibility information with your current React Native version.

2. **Update or Downgrade:**  If an update is available for `my-third-party-library` that supports your React Native version, update to that version.

3. **Downgrade (Use with Caution):** If no compatible update is available, consider temporarily downgrading your React Native version to one explicitly supported by the library. This is a last resort; prefer updating the library.

4. **Alternative Libraries:** Look for alternative libraries that provide similar functionality and are compatible with your React Native version.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// Updated Code (after addressing incompatibility, perhaps using a different library or version)
import CompatibleComponent from 'compatible-library'; // Replace with your chosen alternative

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <CompatibleComponent data={myData} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
